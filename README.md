# industry-practices
A repository to maintain best coding industry practices from what I have learned throughout my career

Here I have listed a table of good and no-so-good practices of doing things in the software engineering industry.

## Git

Task | Not so good practice | Good practice
--- | --- | --- 
Commit messages | Text message describing the change made | Maintain a code format for commit messages. A common one would be <PROJECT_CODE>:<VERSION><JIRA_ID>#<ISSUE_ID><COMMIT_MESSAGE>. Example: FR:2.2.10:FR-865#569Update config.json 
Creating tasks | No task creation | Create an issue from the latest branch as a merge request and assign it to the developer with an appropriate label
Versioning | No versioning | Maintain versions of releases following proper naming convensions
